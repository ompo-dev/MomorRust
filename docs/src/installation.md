# Installing Momor

## Download Momor

### macOS

Get the latest stable builds via [the download page](https://momor.dev/download). If you want to download our preview build, you can find it on its [releases page](https://momor.dev/releases/preview). After the first manual installation, Momor will periodically check for install updates.

You can also install Momor stable via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask momor
```

As well as Momor preview:

```sh
brew install --cask momor@preview
```

### Windows

Get the latest stable builds via [the download page](https://momor.dev/download). If you want to download our preview build, you can find it on its [releases page](https://momor.dev/releases/preview). After the first manual installation, Momor will periodically check for install updates.

Additionally, you can install Momor using winget:

```sh
winget install -e --id MomorIndustries.Momor
```

### Linux

For most Linux users, the easiest way to install Momor is through our installation script:

```sh
curl -f https://momor.dev/install.sh | sh
```

You can now optionally specify a **version** of Momor to install using the `MOMOR_VERSION` environment variable:

```sh
# Install the latest stable version (default)
curl -f https://momor.dev/install.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -f https://momor.dev/install.sh | MOMOR_VERSION=0.216.0 sh
```

To install the preview build, which receives updates about a week ahead of stable:

```sh
curl -f https://momor.dev/install.sh | MOMOR_CHANNEL=preview sh
```

This script supports `x86_64` and `AArch64`, as well as common Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Arch, Debian, RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, and more.

If Momor is installed using this installation script, it can be uninstalled at any time by running the shell command `momor --uninstall`. The shell will then prompt you whether you'd like to keep your preferences or delete them. After making a choice, you should see a message that Momor was successfully uninstalled.

If this script is insufficient for your use case, you run into problems running Momor, or there are errors in uninstalling Momor, please see our [Linux-specific documentation](./linux.md).
