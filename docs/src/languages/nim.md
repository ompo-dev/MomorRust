## Formatting

To use [arnetheduck/nph](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph) as a formatter, follow the [nph installation instructions](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

Configure formatting in Settings ({#kb momor::OpenSettings}) under Languages > Nim, or add to your settings file:

```json [settings]
  "languages": {
    "Nim": {
      "formatter": {
        "external": {
          "command": "nph",
          "arguments": ["-"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
